# arcgis-jsapi-ondrawbegin
An example of hacking a "draw-begin" event into the ArcGIS JavaScript API draw toolbar.

Based on the original [ArcGIS Draw Toolbar Example](http://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/samples/toolbar_draw/) provided by ESRI.

This example is only meant as an example, so show how the toolbar could be improved to add a custom event.

In this example, the "draw-begin" event triggers a color change on existing drawings when
the user begins drawing a shape on the map.
